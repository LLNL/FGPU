Attempts to use cuda managed memory in CUDA FORTRAN.

Standalone arrays worked.

Problems encountered using 'managed' on arrays within derived types.
Problems encountered when pointers to these arrays were passed in and out of functions.  Compilers seemed to lose track of the memory being in managed memory.

Early compiler issues with array properties not being propogated through functions.
