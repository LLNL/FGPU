Example of testing the OpenMP workshare construct over FORTRAN vector/array operations.

There is no current mechanism for spreading a workshare over thread teams, so the teams+workshare kernel does not function correctly.
This sharply limits the parallelism available to solve an array operation.

Workshares over a single thread team should work.
