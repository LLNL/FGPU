This example code include a custom openmp reduction function for finding the maximum value in an array, and the location of that maximum value.

Bugs:
- The IBM XLF compiler appears to work fine for this example with an optimization level of '-O2', but if '-O3' is used it returns sporadic results.

Example of -O2 run:
 fortran intrinsics on CPU:
 cpu max 0.999999945983290561 at 11 14 1
 extrinsics on GPU, first call:
 gpu max 0.999999945983290561 at 11 14 1
 extrinsics on GPU, second call:
 gpu max 0.999999945983290561 at 11 14 1
 extrinsics on GPU, third call:
 gpu max 0.999999945983290561 at 11 14 1

With -O3, the gpu results are wrong, and not consistent.
