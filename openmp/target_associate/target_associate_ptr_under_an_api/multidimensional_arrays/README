Example testing the OpenMP capability to pair together a host and device pointer that was allocated outside of a map clause.
This version tests:
- a multidimension FORTRAN array
- putting the code for the pointer pairing in a subroutine, which allows selecting either a native OpenMP map pragma or the manual pointer associate/disassociate calls at runtime.
