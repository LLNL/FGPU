Small test of applying OpenMP parallel do over a non-rectangular loop nest that doesn't conform to OpenMP spec.

This shouldn't compile, as its not legal OpenMP.  The compiler is unable to determine the loop bounds at compile time.

The IBM XLF compiler compiles this and gets an out-of-bounds memory access error at runtime.

Other compilers emit an error at compile time, stating the the loop is a non-rectangular iteration nest and does not conform to spec.
