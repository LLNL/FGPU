Troubleshooting runtime errors in OpenMP can be difficult due to the runtime error messages not pinpointing where in code an error is occuring.

These two examples demonstrate common error conditions:
- an overlapping data map
- an out of bounds access

Vendors should provide sufficient error messages from these use cases for a developer to be able to track down where in the code the error is originating.  Some solutions are adding tracing info to the runtime, or having the runtime hook into the DWARF info from a debug executable.
