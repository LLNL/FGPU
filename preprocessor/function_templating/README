Example of mapping nested data structures.

This code example is using the target_associate_ptr call to show how an 'external' memory allocator can be used with OpenMP.

This version is using the preprocessor to create several versions of each function for each needed data type, instead of duplicating the source code multiple times.

This is a rough prototype.  This technique was inspired by the Fortran FTL project at https://github.com/SCM-NV/ftl.
