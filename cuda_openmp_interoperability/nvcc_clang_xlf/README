This test code contains a main driver which executes several different saxpy kernels.

It uses a common compiler configuration on SIERRA - a mixture of NVCC + CLANG + XLF to provide gpu kernels in CUDA C, OpenMP CPU threading via CLANG, and OpenMP GPU FORTRAN kernels with XLF.

NVCC CUDA C
CLANG OPENMP4.5 C
XLF OPENMP4.5 FORTRAN
