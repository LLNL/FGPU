This example tests the capability to map over sections of an array to the GPU.

The 'array slices' examples map over slices of 2d arrays.

The 'type ptrs' examples map over slices of a 1d array containing types pointers.

Important note:
When mapping over multiple sections of an array, it's important to also repeat the map of that slice in the kernel markup.
Otherwise, it's ambiguous on which array slice the runtime should expect to use.
