This example tests the capability to map or updates slices of an array to/from the GPU.

Important note:
When mapping over multiple sections of an array, it's important to also repeat the map of that slice in the OpenMP kernel pragmas.
Otherwise, it's ambiguous on which array slice the runtime should expect to use, and you'll encounter overlapping map errors from the runtime when it attempts to implicitly map the entire array over.
