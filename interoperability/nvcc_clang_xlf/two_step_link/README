This code example shows the complicated two-step link required on the DOE SIERRA platform when using both CUDA and OpenMP kernels in C++ and FORTRAN.

NOTE - This combination of compilers does not allow both C OpenMP GPU kernels and FORTRAN OpenMP GPU kernels to run.  The CLANG and XL OpenMP GPU runtimes are not compatible.
