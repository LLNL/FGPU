This test code contains a main driver which executes several different saxpy kernels.

It uses a common compiler configuration on SIERRA - a mixture of NVCC + CLANG + XLF to provide gpu kernels in CUDA C, OpenMP CPU threading via CLANG, and OpenMP GPU FORTRAN kernels with XLF.

NVCC CUDA C
--DISABLED-- CLANG OPENMP4.5 (GPU) C
CLANG OPENMP C
XLF OPENMP4.5 (GPU) FORTRAN

NOTE - This combination of compilers does not allow both C OpenMP GPU kernels and FORTRAN OpenMP GPU kernels to run.  The CLANG and XL OpenMP GPU runtimes are not compatible.
