This test code contains a main driver which executes a CUDA C kernel and an OpenMP device kernel.
It tests the ability of these two kernels to run back-to-back and each access a large portion of the GPU memory.

Device memory allocations for both kernels are handled through OpenMP.

This example has trouble on the DOE Sierra machine because the OpenMP runtime makes use of a memory pool for the OpenMP data maps.
The memory pool does not release all its device memory which causes the omp_target_alloc call to fail when trying to allocate memory.
