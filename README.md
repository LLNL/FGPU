This is a collection of code examples focusing on porting FORTRAN codes to run on the IBM OpenPOWER DOE platforms using OpenMP or CUDA.  The purpose of these is to provide both learning aids for developers and a regression test for compilers supporting OpenMP4.5 and CUDA FORTRAN, etc.

While these examples have a heavy FORTRAN emphasis, some examples also include C++ usage for use in demonstrating OpenMP or CUDA with mixed C++/FORTRAN language executables.

* cuda - examples pertaining to NVIDIA CUDA
* openmp - examples using OpenMP target offloading capability to run on GPUs
* test cases - a variety of cases derived from the SIERRA COE effort, including performance tests, compiler interoperabilty, compiler bugs encountered with OpenMP, etc.
