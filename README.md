This is a collection of code examples focusing on porting FORTRAN codes to run DOE heterogenous architecture CPU+GPU machines.  The purpose of these is to provide both learning aids for developers and OpenMP and CUDA code examples for testing vendor compilers capabilities.

While these examples have a heavy FORTRAN emphasis, some examples also include C++ usage for use in demonstrating OpenMP or CUDA with mixed C++/FORTRAN language executables.
