This test code contains a main driver which executes several different saxpy kernels.

Used to test debugging and setting breakpoints in cuda-gdb or totalview.

These examples show that compiling/linking a CUDA C kernel with NVCC produces DWARF2 info that  works with NVIDIA tools like cuda-memcheck, etc.

The code examples linking with XL do not produce kernel code DWARF that the NVIDIA tools recognize.

Fix - worked once -rdc flag was dropped from NVCC line.

NVCC CUDA C
XLF CUDAFORTRAN
XLC OPENMP4.5 C
XLF OPENMP4.5 FORTRAN

NVCC CUDA C - standalone - compiled and links with NVCC only
